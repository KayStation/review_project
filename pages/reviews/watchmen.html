                <p1>Watchmen is a kind-of sequel to one of the greatest graphic novels of all time of the same name. It sits in a strange valley of not being all too connected to its predecessor, while at the same time definitely requiring having seen it for much of the context. Not only that, but it focuses on the story told in the original graphic novel, and not the alterations made for the 2009 Zack Snyder movie. However, for those who fit into the niche of having read the comic, it is an absolute treasure.
                    <br><br>
                    Altering drastically from the previous work, it is unabashedly its own story with its own set of characters and themes. Taking place over 30  years since the original plot, Watchmen is a ‘superhero show’ where just about none of the characters have powers. The single one who does, the omnipotent, nude, Dr. Manhattan is nowhere to be seen despise the fact that he is now needed more than ever as a white supremacist group conducts plots behind the scenes.
                    <br><br>
                    The decision to change so drastically has raised controversy by fans of the original work, though by its positive ratings, seem to not affect the quality overall. The modern-day political atmosphere of the show mirror the political tension present at the time the original novel was released, the story focusing on the cold war. I believe that current politics are integral to both the original work, and the show only continues the trend.
